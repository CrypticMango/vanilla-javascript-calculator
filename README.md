# vanilla-javascript-calculator

Hello! I am a web dev in training, mostly learning on my own using 
tutorials and just good ole google. This is a Vanilla Javascript 
Calculator project that I created from scratch on my own using what 
I know and googling the things that I do not know. My goal is to
create more and more complicated projects all on my own so that I
become efficient in solving problems and coding independantly as fast
as possible.

Here is a link to the project if you would like to check it out.
